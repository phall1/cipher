It's a general question about color theory, so I'll answer it without referencing the given context.\n\nA random fact about color theory is that complementary colors, which are opposite each other on the color wheel, create the strongest contrast when placed side by side. For example, blue and orange, or red and green are complementary pairs. This principle is often used in art and design to create visually striking compositions or to make certain elements stand out."

Ukraine's army chief recently visited brigades defending the Novopavlivka front, where Russian forces are intensifying assaults [2]. Simultaneously, Ukraine is preparing for talks with the Trump administration, seeking security guarantees against future Russian aggression [5]. However, there are concerns about the U.S. negotiator's suggestion of using the 2022 Istanbul talks as a template for peace, which Ukraine views as unfavorable [4]. Ukrainian officials stress the importance of maintaining independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity in any peace deal [3][4]."
