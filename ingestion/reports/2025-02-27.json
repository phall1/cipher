          "content": "A Damaged U.S.-Europe Relationship – and What it Means for Ukraine. Council on Foreign Relations Senior Fellow Max Boot, a Washington Post columnist, and American Enterprise Institute Director of Foreign and Defense Policy Kori Schake analyze the Trump administration’s shift away from European allies and Ukraine. Boot sees this as a potential end to the post-World War II transatlantic alliance, while Schake criticizes Trump’s neutrality between Russia and Ukraine, calling it a betrayal of democratic values. Boot notes Europe’s increasing military spending and interest in nuclear deterrence as a response. Both stress that Ukraine depends on U.S. aid, particularly for air defenses, and Schake warns of increased civilian casualties if support ceases. Boot argues Ukraine can sustain itself in the short term but faces major risks without U.S. contributions. Both experts see Trump as transactional, prioritizing deals over alliances, with Schake doubting any agreement could satisfy Vladimir Putin. They conclude that U.S. credibility as a security partner is already damaged, with repercussions extending beyond Europe."

As President Volodymyr Zelensky prepares for talks with Donald Trump, Goncharenko stresses Ukraine’s three red lines: independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. He argues that any peace deal must not recognize Russian occupation. While welcoming U.S. business investments, he remains concerned about the absence of security guarantees in negotiations. He urges Trump to see Ukraine not as a burden but as a strategic asset, highlighting its battle-hardened military. If U.S. support weakens, Ukraine will continue fighting but at immense cost. He cautions that abandoning Ukraine would damage America’s global standing, likening it to a prolonged Afghanistan scenario. Goncharenko also warns that Europe must decide whether to be a player or a pawn in geopolitics. He urges unity, stating, 'The best way to make America great again is not to make America single again.'"

President Donald Trump struck a more supportive tone on Ukraine during his meetings with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday, but stopped short of promising the security guarantees for Kyiv that European allies want. Starmer raised a plan to send European peacekeepers to Ukraine, seeking a U.S. military “backstop” of air defenses and intelligence support. Trump repeatedly said he would only consider those options after a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv, an agreement he expects Russian President Vladimir Putin to honor. “I have confidence, if we make a deal, it’s going to hold,” he said in the Oval Office, adding that his approach would be “trust and verify.” Trump also tempered some of his harshest criticisms of Ukraine, saying he “can’t believe” he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “dictator” and vowing to help Kyiv reclaim as much seized territory from Russia as possible. Trump is set to meet with Zelensky on Friday. “We’re going to get along really well. I have a lot of respect for him,” Trump said of Zelensky."

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky quickly adapted to Donald Trump’s transactional approach, turning a hostile stance into a White House invitation. Just days ago, Trump falsely called Zelensky a “dictator” who started the war with Russia, but by Friday, the Ukrainian leader secured a meeting by offering what Trump values most: a deal. Zelensky agreed to a rare earth minerals pact with the U.S., reframing it as a framework for future cooperation rather than a forced concession. Eager to claim victory, Trump declared, “We’re going to be signing an agreement, which will be a very big agreement.” Zelensky, in turn, positioned the deal as leverage for U.S. security guarantees. Trump’s philosophy is clear: “I do deals. My whole life is deals.” By playing into this mindset, Zelensky moved from being dismissed to a full White House welcome. The shift underscores how foreign leaders must navigate Trump’s priorities to maintain U.S. support. CNN"

The Istanbul negotiations occurred when Russian forces threatened Kyiv, and Ukraine was under severe pressure.

Ovidio, along with his brothers, known as the Chapitos, inherited their father’s criminal network and expanded it into one of the world’s largest fentanyl operations, according to U.S. authorities.

Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, founder of CK Hutchison, is facing renewed scrutiny over his company’s operations of two ports at the Panama Canal. U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed that “China is operating the Panama Canal,” referencing CK Hutchison’s port management, a concern that dates back to the company’s acquisition of these contracts in 1997. In response, Panamanian lawyers have initiated a lawsuit to annul these concessions, and the Panamanian government has commenced an audit of CK Hutchison’s activities. Despite these challenges, CK Hutchison is pursuing expansion plans, including a preliminary £7 billion bid for a majority stake in the UK’s Thames Water. Analysts warn that geopolitical tensions may hinder such endeavors. Li Ka-shing, who has historically maintained a complex relationship with Beijing, now finds his company increasingly perceived as a Chinese entity, especially following Hong Kong’s 1997 handover and recent political developments. This perception poses significant challenges for CK Hutchison’s global operations and investment strategies. Financial Times"

Costa Rica and Panama are facing backlash for their treatment of migrants, including confiscating passports and cellphones, denying legal access, and relocating migrants without transparency, as they struggle to manage an unexpected influx of reverse migration. Both countries have received hundreds of deportees from the U.S., where President Donald Trump’s administration has accelerated deportations. At the same time, thousands of migrants, unable to enter the U.S., have started travelling southward through Central America. One expert at the University of Costa Rica said “we’re a reflection of current United States immigration policy,” and lamented the lack of “focus on human rights” amid a preoccupation with “control and security.” Panama’s Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Ruiz-Hernandez stated that some deportees are being temporarily housed and provided medical support before being sent back to their home countries. However, migrants report being detained without clear information, denied legal assistance, and forced into relocation. Meanwhile, Costa Rica’s Ombudsman’s Office has raised similar concerns about the treatment of deportees. Migrants describe confusion and isolation as they are moved between detention centers and transport hubs. While officials claim to be assisting migrants, journalists covering the situation have reported attempts by authorities to restrict access to information. Associated Press "

The victims, who died from execution, torture, or maltreatment, were buried at seven suspected grave sites identified through witness testimony, satellite imagery, and leaked documents.

Explosions targeted a rally hosted by M23 rebels in Bukavu, eastern Congo, on Tuesday, killing at least 11 people and leaving 65 injured. Rebel leaders, who recently seized control of the city amid a lightning offensive, blamed the Congolese government, while President Felix Tshisekedi attributed the attack to “foreign” forces. Conflicting reports emerged on the number of casualties and attackers. The assault occurred as M23 leaders, including the Congo River Alliance (AFC) chief Corneille Nangaa, addressed residents. Footage showed panicked crowds and casualties. Local officials called the attack “sabotage,” with some victims requiring amputations. After, Nangaa asserted that the rebel coalition was “obliged to react,” and condemned the “criminal regime of Kinshasa” for its alleged plot “of exterminating civilian populations.” Tshisekedi maintained that the attack was “a heinous terrorist act” carried out by a “foreign army illegally present on Congolese soil.” Associated Press Reuters The Independent France 24  "

          "content": "French prosecutors close case filed by Congo against Apple over conflict minerals. French prosecutors have dropped a case filed by the Democratic Republic of Congo against Apple subsidiaries, which accused them of using conflict minerals in their supply chain. The Paris prosecutor’s office stated that allegations of money laundering and deceptive business practices were “not sufficiently well-founded” and dismissed the case. In a document examined by Reuters and dated February 18, the prosecutors suggested that Congo contact a different office handling war crimes. Congo’s lawyers criticized the decision and plan to challenge it, citing the seriousness of the accusations. The country is a major supplier of 3T minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten), which are essential for electronics but are often sourced from mines controlled by armed groups involved in human rights abuses, such as mass rapes, massacres of civilians, looting and other crimes. Apple had denied the allegations, asserting that its suppliers are prohibited from using minerals sourced from Congo or Rwanda. While France dropped the case, Belgium has appointed an investigating magistrate to review similar complaints filed there. Reuters "

          "content": "Experts question if Senegal’s peace deal with separatist rebels will end decades of conflict. Senegal’s government has signed a new peace deal with a faction of the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance (MFDC) in an effort to end the decades-long separatist conflict in the southern Casamance region. This week, Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko hailed the agreement as a step toward lasting peace, offering amnesty, social reintegration, and a presidential pardon for imprisoned rebels. However, analysts argue that the deal is incomplete as it excludes the most powerful faction led by hardliner Salif Sadio and does not address the root causes of the conflict, such as the region’s historical neglect and underdevelopment. Critics believe that without broader political and administrative concessions, peace will remain elusive. While younger generations in Casamance increasingly identify with Senegal, the MFDC’s hardline faction still demands independence. Some rebel groups have accused the government of selectively negotiating, which they argue undermines genuine peace efforts. The rebels themselves have not officially responded to the deal.

Silicon Valley defense-tech companies are seizing new opportunities under the Trump administration’s push to modernize the Pentagon, with startups like Anduril Industries, Palantir Technologies, and Epirus lobbying for contracts in areas such as autonomous drones and a next-generation “Golden Dome” missile-defense shield. This shift, driven by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, seeks to cut costs, favor commercial innovation, and reduce dependence on traditional defense contractors. A proposed missile-defense system using technology from Anduril, Palantir, and SpaceX is being reviewed by Pentagon officials. While startups see this as a long-awaited opening to gain a larger share of defense spending, they still face resistance from established contractors and Congressional allies who want to protect legacy programs and jobs. The administration’s outreach to venture capitalists and efforts to prioritize tech-driven solutions represent a major cultural shift for the Pentagon, though it remains uncertain whether startups will fully displace traditional defense giants.

U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has raised concerns over the British government’s reported demand for Apple to create backdoor access to encrypted cloud data. In a response to Congress, Gabbard warned that such a demand would violate Americans’ privacy rights and set a troubling precedent of a foreign government pressuring a U.S. tech company. The issue arose after Apple announced it would stop offering its Advanced Data Protection feature in the U.K. following a secret order from British security officials seeking access to encrypted iCloud data. Gabbard has called for a review of the U.K.’s request by U.S. intelligence agencies and emphasized that existing agreements prohibit such data demands between the two nations. The controversy comes amid broader concerns over intelligence-sharing relationships under President Donald Trump. While British authorities have not commented, Gabbard, known for her past criticisms of government surveillance, stressed the need for Washington and London to balance security with civil liberties.

OpenAI has released GPT-4.5, marking the final version of its chatbot system before shifting to “chain-of-thought reasoning,” where AI will take more time to think before responding. While GPT-4.5 improves conversational flow and user understanding, it is unlikely to generate as much excitement as GPT-4, as AI research is now focusing on reasoning systems that solve complex tasks step by step. The company’s vice president of research, Mia Glaese, said that the new model has the capability “to engage in warm, intuitive, naturally flowing conversations, and we think it has a stronger understanding of what users mean when they ask for something.” Companies like Google, Meta, and DeepSeek are also developing reasoning AI, which could be especially useful for coding, math, and scientific applications. These systems use reinforcement learning, a process where AI learns from trial and error over time. One challenge for OpenAI and its competitors is that they have exhausted most available internet data to train models like GPT-4.5, pushing them toward reasoning-based AI development. While reasoning AIs perform well on standardized tests, they still make errors and “hallucinate” information. New York Times"

Cameron Wagenius, a 21-year-old U.S. Army soldier, has been accused of attempting to sell stolen sensitive information to a foreign intelligence service while also trying to extort $500,000 from AT&T by threatening to leak call records of high-ranking officials. According to court documents, Wagenius attempted to defect to Russia, conducting online searches on how to flee the U.S. military and whether hacking could be considered treason. Prosecutors allege he engaged with state-level actors, blurring the line between cybercrime and national security threats. His alleged activities were linked to a broader cybercrime operation that targeted 165 organizations using stolen Snowflake cloud data. His co-conspirators, Connor Moucka and John Binns, were previously indicted for extorting over 10 organizations, including AT&T, which confirmed the breach in July. Authorities seized Wagenius’ devices in December, uncovering access to thousands of stolen identification documents and large amounts of cryptocurrency. Despite orders from his commanding officer, he purchased a new laptop and used VPN software to continue his activities from Fort Cavazos in Texas. Cybercrime experts warn that this case highlights the growing intersection between financial cybercrime and national security threats. Prosecutors argue that Wagenius presents a serious flight risk and expect additional charges. Cyberscoop Bloomberg "

A recent CrowdStrike report revealed that cyberattacks by China-backed nation-state hackers increased by a “terrifying” 150% in 2024, showcasing advanced technical capabilities and specialized targeting across critical global sectors, including finance, media, manufacturing, and telecoms. China has developed highly skilled cyber units capable of conducting persistent and undetected intrusions. New threat groups such as Liminal Panda, Locksmith Panda, and Operator Panda have targeted telecom networks and critical infrastructure worldwide. Operator Panda (also known as Salt Typhoon) was responsible for a prolonged cyber campaign against U.S. and global telecom providers, remaining active as recently as January. Chinese hackers are moving from “smash-and-grab” tactics (quick data theft) to long-term network infiltration, using botnet-based relay networks (ORB networks) to hide their activities. One of the most concerning groups, Volt Typhoon (Vanguard Panda), has been infiltrating critical logistics infrastructure—including maritime, air, and intercontinental travel networks—potentially to disrupt U.S. military operations in a conflict scenario, such as a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Experts warn that China is not only gathering intelligence but actively pre-positioning cyber forces to limit the U.S.’s ability to respond to future conflicts. If the U.S. deploys a carrier strike group to deter Chinese aggression in Taiwan, cyber disruptions could cripple supply chains, food, and water logistics, weakening military readiness. CrowdStrike emphasized the need for improved cyber defenses to deter China’s growing offensive cyber capabilities, which now rival those of other global powers.

The FBI is urging the private sector to help contain the $1.5 billion stolen from the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange by North Korean hackers linked to the Lazarus Group (TraderTraitor). The agency released a list of Ethereum wallet addresses tied to the attack and warned that the hackers are rapidly laundering the funds by converting them into Bitcoin and other assets across multiple blockchains. Blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs reported that $400 million has already been laundered, highlighting the speed of the operation. The attack stemmed from the compromise of a Safe Wallet developer machine, affecting a Bybit account, according to the wallet service Safe. Bybit is offering up to $140 million in bounties to individuals who can help recover the stolen funds, with $4.2 million already awarded to “hunters” as of Thursday.
