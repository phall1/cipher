THE UKRAINE UPDATE

Trump says he may meet with Zelensky to sign mineral deal this week or next. U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday he expects to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky this week or next to sign a minerals deal. The agreement, nearing completion, would grant the U.S. a stake in Ukraine’s natural resource revenues. Deputy Prime Minister Olha Stefanishyna confirmed the final stage of negotiations. A draft agreement reviewed by Bloomberg and The New York Times shows Ukraine has secured better terms than earlier proposals, with the U.S. dropping its demand for Kyiv to commit $500 billion in future revenues. However, Ukraine’s push for security guarantees remains unfulfilled. Trump’s administration frames the deal as part of its effort to end Russia’s war on Ukraine. While U.S. officials argue economic ties will deter future aggression, Zelensky insists military aid must be included. The agreement’s terms could still evolve, with more negotiations expected after the signing. NV Bloomberg New York Times

EU offers its own ‘win-win’ deal with Ukraine on critical minerals. The European Union proposed its own deal with Ukraine on “critical materials,” offering what EU officials described as a “win-win” partnership, in contrast to U.S. President Donald Trump’s demand for compensation. European Commissioner for Industrial Strategy Stephane Sejourne, visiting Kyiv with Ursula von der Leyen on Monday, noted that Ukraine could supply 21 of the 30 critical materials Europe needs, including manganese, titanium, graphite, and lithium. “The added value Europe offers is that we will never demand a deal that’s not mutually beneficial,” he said. Meanwhile, Trump insisted the U.S. was “very close” to securing its deal, saying, “I want them to give us something for all of the money that we put up.” The competing proposals reflect broader geopolitical tensions as Ukraine navigates economic partnerships amid Russia’s ongoing war.

Putin Dangles Rare Earths Deals for U.S. in Russia and Kremlin-Occupied Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin invited U.S. companies to develop Russia’s vast rare earth mineral deposits, including those in Russian-occupied Ukraine. In a state TV interview, he emphasized that Russia’s reserves far exceed Ukraine’s and highlighted opportunities for American firms in Siberian aluminum production and energy projects. Putin specifically mentioned that rare earth extraction in parts of Ukraine seized by Russia could be lucrative, signaling Moscow’s intent to integrate these resources into its economy. He framed the offer as a pragmatic business opportunity. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed discussions with Russia on economic development, aligning with his broader strategy to replace confrontation with deal-making. He suggested that American businesses could profit from access to these resources, reinforcing his view that economic partnerships should take precedence over policies imposing tough sanctions on Russia for its war on Ukraine.

Trump refuses to label Putin a dictator. During a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House on Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump declined to call Russian President Vladimir Putin a dictator, saying he doesn’t use such terms “lightly.” This contrasts with his Feb. 19 post on Truth Social, where he labeled Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “dictator” over postponed elections, disregarding Ukraine’s martial law restrictions and echoing Russian propaganda.

Zelensky, Trump have ‘good’ conversation during G7 meeting. President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven (G7) online meeting on Monday. “As for Donald Trump… We have just had a conversation. It was a very good conversation within the framework of the G7 meeting led by Canada,” Zelensky said, thanking Ottawa for organizing the event. The Ukrainian president expressed hope that the U.S. would maintain its support for Ukraine, emphasizing the need to preserve unity between Washington and European allies. Kyiv Independent

Reclaiming occupied territories possible but ‘not easy’ for Ukraine, Trump says. U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that Ukraine might be able to reclaim some Russian-occupied territories but acknowledged “that’s not an easy thing to do.” Speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House, he suggested the issue is part of ongoing negotiations that have recently begun.

U.S. Refuses to Blame Russia for Ukraine War in Extraordinary Break with Allies. The United Nations and Group of Seven nations struggled to maintain a unified stance on Russia’s war on Ukraine as the Trump administration aligned with Moscow. In the UN General Assembly, the U.S. and Russia both voted against a European-backed resolution explicitly condemning Russia’s invasion and calling for the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops. A separate U.S. resolution, which initially avoided blaming Russia, was amended to include accountability language, prompting the U.S. to abstain from its own proposal. At the UN Security Council, the U.S. and Russia, for the first time, backed the same resolution calling for a “swift end” to the war without assigning blame. Meanwhile, G7 leaders struggled to draft a joint statement as the U.S. opposed language condemning Russia and resisted new energy sanctions. The divide underscores President Donald Trump’s push for direct negotiations with President Vladimir Putin while sidelining Ukraine and Europe, reshaping alliances in the war’s fourth year.

Macron contradicts Trump on Ukraine as Europe-U.S. divide deepens. During their Monday meeting at the White House, French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Donald Trump maintained a friendly tone while exposing deep divisions over Ukraine. Macron declared, “The aggressor is Russia,” while Trump refused to call Vladimir Putin a dictator, instead emphasizing his push for a swift ceasefire. “We want peace, and we want it fast,” Trump said, sidestepping commitments to Ukrainian security. Macron pushed back: “We don’t want an agreement that is weak.” Tensions flared when Trump falsely claimed Europe had only loaned money to Ukraine. Macron, placing a hand on Trump’s arm, corrected him: “No, in fact, we paid. We provided real money.” The leaders did agree on a European peacekeeping force after a ceasefire, though Macron dismissed Putin’s credibility, recalling, “I spent seven hours with him before the invasion. He denied everything.” Trump also promoted his minerals deal with Ukraine as a way to recoup U.S. military aid, while Macron insisted any peace must be “checked and verified.” Reuters New York Times Time The Times CNN Associated Press Politico EU

ANALYSIS–Facing Trump’s Hostility, Ukraine Weighs Its Options. But They Are Few. President Donald Trump’s adversarial stance toward Ukraine has forced Kyiv to reconsider its strategic options as U.S. support wanes. In the past two weeks, Trump has initiated direct peace talks with Russia, sidelined Ukraine, falsely blamed Kyiv for the war and called President Volodymyr Zelensky a dictator. Ukraine is seeking alternatives, pivoting toward Europe while leveraging economic deals to maintain ties with Washington. A proposed minerals deal remains contentious, with Trump demanding onerous terms – billions of dollars in resources as “payback” for past aid – with no security guarantees or promises of further military aid. Ukraine aims to hold out on the battlefield but might be able to do so for only a matter of months if U.S. aid dries up. Ukraine is boosting domestic arms production, particularly of attack drones, but challenges persist, including troop shortages. Meanwhile, European leaders, including France’s Emmanuel Macron and the UK’s Keir Starmer, are discussing peacekeeping troops and a new $21 billion financial package. Ukraine hopes Trump’s need to claim a diplomatic victory will keep it relevant in negotiations. For now, Kyiv’s survival strategy hinges on European backing, internal resilience, and the possibility of Trump unexpectedly reversing course if Russia stalls talks. New York Times

EU eyes €200 billion secret weapon as Trump dominates Ukraine peace talks. With the U.S. and Russia sidelining the EU in Ukraine peace talks, European leaders are debating whether to seize €200 billion in frozen Russian assets to regain influence. Held mainly in Brussels-based Euroclear, the funds accrue interest, while the U.S. holds only $5 billion. Baltic and Nordic states, alongside Poland and Czechia, support immediately transferring the money to Ukraine, arguing it could replace potential lost U.S. aid. However, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warn that confiscating the funds could deter investors and weaken Europe’s negotiation leverage. French President Emmanuel Macron suggested using only the interest rather than seizing the assets, emphasizing their value as a bargaining chip. Estonia acknowledges that withholding the funds strengthens Europe’s hand, ensuring Russia has an incentive to negotiate. With G7 finance ministers meeting this week, the debate over leveraging or unlocking the assets remains unresolved. Politico EU

Trump says Putin will accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept the deployment of European peacekeepers in Ukraine if a ceasefire deal is reached. “He will accept that. I have asked him that question,” Trump stated at the White House alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. He added, “If we do this deal, he’s not looking for more war.” Macron, who has discussed the idea with the U.K., said European forces would not be on the front lines but would ensure that any agreement is upheld. While Trump remained ambiguous, Macron called the talks a “turning point,” suggesting some form of American support. Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s upcoming visit on Thursday will test whether this diplomatic push yields concrete commitments. Politico EU The Economist

Putin says Europe is needed in Ukraine talks but suggests a deal is still distant. In an interview with Russian state TV at his residence outside Moscow on Monday, President Vladimir Putin suggested that a Ukraine peace deal remains distant, emphasizing the need first to build trust between Russia and the U.S. He said recent talks in Riyadh with American officials were preliminary, adding, “We only agreed that we would move toward this.” He acknowledged that European countries would eventually be needed in negotiations to end the war in Ukraine. Putin also spoke approvingly about cutting U.S. and Russian defense spending in half, though no concrete steps were discussed. He praised President Donald Trump’s pragmatic approach to Ukraine, contrasting it with European leaders he sees as constrained by prior commitments. However, he gave no indication that Russia was ready to make concessions, suggesting that a final settlement could take significant time to materialize. Reuters

Without U.S. Aid, Ukraine Would Lose Some of Its Most Sophisticated Weapons. Ukraine could sustain its current military effort until mid-2025 with existing U.S. aid, but without further supplies, Kyiv would face shortages in ammunition and irreplaceable high-end weaponry. Key systems at risk include Patriot air-defense batteries, ATACMS missiles for long-range strikes, and navigation systems essential for precision targeting—none of which Europe can replace in the short term. The U.S. has supplied nearly $70 billion in military aid, more than all other allies combined. While Ukraine has ramped up its own production, producing millions of drones and increasing munitions output, its domestic industry and European allies would struggle to cover the gap left by lost U.S. supplies. President Donald Trump’s hostility toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Republican resistance to further aid have raised the possibility of U.S. withdrawal. European leaders are scrambling to adjust, but analysts doubt their ability to fully compensate, particularly in air defense and long-range strike capabilities. Wall Street Journal

The staggering cost of Russia’s war in Ukraine, by the numbers. Russia’s war on Ukraine has resulted in at least 153,000 deaths, with 95,000 Russian soldiers and 46,000 Ukrainian troops among them. Over 10.6 million Ukrainians have been displaced, and 2 million homes—about 10% of Ukraine’s housing stock—have been destroyed. Russia now controls approximately 20% of Ukraine’s territory. The U.S. has spent $65.9 billion on military aid, with total Ukraine-related U.S. spending reaching $174.2 billion. European aid has surpassed Washington’s in financial and humanitarian support, with total global assistance reaching $279 billion. Washington Post

Ukraine needs $524 billion to recover, rebuild after three years of war, World Bank says. The World Bank, United Nations, European Union, and Ukraine estimate the cost of rebuilding Ukraine at $524 billion, a 7% increase from last year’s $486 billion estimate. Damage to the energy sector has risen 70% due to Russian attacks, with housing, transport, and industry among the most affected sectors. Ukraine has allocated $7.37 billion for 2025 but faces a $10 billion funding gap. Direct damage now totals $176 billion. About 13% of housing stock is damaged, affecting 2.5 million households. U.S. President Donald Trump is pursuing separate negotiations to end the war, suggesting a deal could come within weeks. Reuters

Ukraine parliament affirms no elections during wartime in rebuff to Trump. Ukraine’s parliament passed a resolution on Tuesday affirming Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s legitimacy as president and stating elections cannot be held until after the war ends. The move rebuffs U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who have questioned Zelenskyy’s authority due to the lack of elections. The resolution passed on the second attempt after an earlier failure. Zelenskyy, elected in 2019, remains in power under martial law, which prohibits elections. He has said he would step down for peace or NATO membership. Opposition parties agree elections are unfeasible due to displacement, ongoing fighting, and the risk of Russian interference. ABC News

Mike Waltz rejects the idea of Ukraine joining NATO amid peace talks. White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said that Ukraine’s NATO membership is “not back on the table,” despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s recent offer to resign in exchange for joining the alliance. Speaking Monday on Fox & Friends, Waltz emphasized that the U.S. would not commit troops under NATO’s Article 5 for Ukraine. Instead, he reiterated that France, the U.K., and other European nations should take the lead on Ukraine’s security guarantees, aligning with the Trump administration’s push for Europe to assume greater responsibility for its own defense.

Putin must be forced to make concessions, Starmer tells Kyiv summit. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told world leaders gathered in Kyiv on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin must be pressured “not just to talk, but to make concessions.” He called for tougher sanctions on Russian banks and oil companies, urging the G7 to “dial up economic pressure.” While acknowledging that Trump’s peace efforts created an opportunity, Starmer insisted Ukraine must be directly involved in negotiations and that any settlement must guarantee its sovereignty. He reaffirmed the UK’s willingness to deploy troops as part of a future peacekeeping force. Starmer will meet U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday. The Times

Germany’s Merz offers hope for Ukraine amid the Trump nightmare. Friedrich Merz’s rise as Germany’s next chancellor offers Ukraine a crucial advocate amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s shifting stance. Merz calls for European defense independence, proposing deeper security ties with France and the U.K. He takes a hard line on Russia and sees Trump’s approach as a threat to Europe. His likely coalition partners, including Defense Minister Boris Pistorius and the hawkish Greens, favor stronger military aid to Ukraine. “Americans are not just leaving Europe alone, but are working against Europe,” Green Party leader Robert Habeck said on Sunday, after the polls closed. “They are letting Ukraine down. I would say they are betraying it. This is imperialism at its worst.” With European Union leaders scrambling to sustain support for Kyiv, Merz’s leadership could be pivotal in ensuring Europe steps up. Politico EU

Europe must use Russian assets for Ukraine, Czech PM says. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala called for using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine’s military and urged Europe to relax fiscal rules to increase defense spending. On national television Monday, he said Czech defense spending must rise to 3% of GDP from 2% to reflect the new geopolitical reality. He noted President Donald Trump’s shift away from Europe, stressing the need for a stronger European Union capable of deterring Russia. Fiala also proposed reallocating €93 billion from post-COVID recovery funds for defense and infrastructure. Reuters

Finnish President to Trump: If Putin wins in Ukraine, the U.S. loses. Finnish President Alexander Stubb warned that a Russian victory in Ukraine would be a loss for the United States, emphasizing that the war concerns European security and American leadership. Speaking in Kyiv at a summit Monday marking three years since Russia’s invasion, he dismissed concerns over NATO’s strength but urged Europe to increase defense spending. Stubb outlined a phased peace plan, starting with bolstering Ukraine’s position, followed by a ceasefire with security guarantees, and ending with a negotiated settlement. He stressed that Ukraine’s European Union and NATO membership must remain non-negotiable and suggested that European military support would focus on air and naval capabilities. Reuters

European leaders in Kyiv mark three years of war, but top U.S. officials stay away. Western leaders gathered in Kyiv to mark three years since Russia’s full-scale invasion, pledging continued support amid growing uncertainty over U.S. policy under President Donald Trump. The U.S. did not send a senior representative, signaling a shift as Trump moves toward direct negotiations with Russia. Trump has embraced parts of the Kremlin’s narrative, called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a “dictator,” and suggested Ukraine may not regain occupied land. Alarmed by Washington’s shift, European leaders are increasing military aid, with Spain pledging over $1 billion and the European Union considering a $20 billion package. The war’s fourth year begins with high-stakes diplomacy and growing divides between the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine. Reuters Associated Press Washington Post 

Russia will not return to the G7, German finance minister says. German Finance Minister Joerg Kukies dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to readmit Russia to the G7 on Monday, stating that it lacked unanimous support. He reaffirmed the G7’s condemnation of Russia’s war against Ukraine, especially on its third anniversary. Kukies, attending the G20 meeting in South Africa, noted ongoing discussions on using $300 billion in frozen Russian assets for Ukraine’s reconstruction. He also warned against a U.S.-European Union trade war but expressed optimism about negotiations. Reuters

Democratic and Republican lawmakers propose resolution backing Ukraine. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a resolution affirming support for Ukraine amid concerns over President Donald Trump’s negotiations with Russia that exclude Kyiv. Led by Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Thom Tillis, the resolution expresses solidarity with Ukraine, acknowledges its war losses, and insists Kyiv must be involved in any ceasefire talks. It reaffirms U.S. backing for Ukraine’s sovereignty and Euro-Atlantic integration but does not explicitly endorse NATO membership. The measure has at least 12 backers, including senior Republicans Mitch McConnell and Roger Wicker, and Democratic leaders like Dick Durbin. Reuters

Analysis: Fair or Not, Zelensky Is Angering Trump. Is His Style Hurting Ukraine? President Volodymyr Zelensky’s firm stance against President Donald Trump’s narrative has strained U.S.-Ukraine relations. Trump, angered by Zelensky’s public corrections of his claims—such as blaming Ukraine for the war—has dismissed him as unimportant to negotiations. Zelensky has refused to sign U.S. minerals deal without security guarantees and insists Ukraine must be involved in any peace talks, a position widely supported in Ukraine but one that has irritated Trump. European leaders have urged Zelensky to be more diplomatic, but he remains defiant, emphasizing that Ukraine’s military resistance has kept the country independent. Critics argue his confrontational style risks jeopardizing U.S. aid, which is crucial as Ukraine faces battlefield challenges. However, Ukraine has historically secured U.S. support through strategic deals rather than personal rapport. With high-stakes diplomacy unfolding, some believe Trump’s transactional nature may ultimately lead him to accept Ukraine’s role in negotiations despite current tensions. New York Times

Zelensky’s toughest battle begins. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky faces his most challenging period three years into Russia’s full-scale invasion. The war effort has stalled, and U.S. President Donald Trump is pursuing a peace deal with Russia that marginalizes Kyiv. Tensions escalated when U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent proposed Ukraine cede 50% of its critical mineral rights to offset $500 billion in military aid—a proposal Zelensky rejected without assurances of continued support. Trump’s disparaging remarks about Zelensky have inadvertently bolstered domestic support for the Ukrainian leader, as citizens perceive external pressures as attempts to force an unfavorable peace settlement. Zelensky’s current challenge is maintaining global engagement and support for Ukraine while navigating complex international dynamics. Financial Times

EU imports of Russian fossil fuels exceeded aid to Ukraine in the third year of the Russian invasion. Despite efforts to reduce reliance on Russian energy, the European Union spent €21.9 billion on Russian fossil fuels in the third year of the war—exceeding the €18.7 billion it provided in aid to Ukraine. The findings are from a new report published by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air on Monday. Russian natural gas imports rose 9%, while fossil fuel imports declined only 1%. Loopholes and weak sanctions have allowed Russia to earn €825 billion from fossil fuels since the war began. Stronger sanctions could cut Moscow’s revenues by €51 billion annually. China, India, and Turkey account for 74% of Russia’s fossil fuel exports. Kyiv Independent

Russia’s Ryazan oil refinery halts operations after drone strike, sources say. Ukraine’s drone strike on Russia’s Ryazan oil refinery caused a fire and halted operations, affecting CDU-6, which processes 170,000 barrels per day (48% of the refinery’s capacity). The plant may partially resume operations soon, using CDU-4 and CDU-3, which together handle 145,000 bpd. The refinery, owned by Rosneft, had only recently restarted after an earlier drone attack in January. In 2024, Ryazan processed 13.1 million tons of crude, contributing nearly 5% of Russia’s refining throughput. Reuters

Russia detains teenager suspected of helping Ukraine target the Ryazan oil refinery with drones. Russian authorities detained a 17-year-old in Bashkortostan, accusing him of aiding Ukraine in targeting the Ryazan oil refinery with drones, RIA reported on Tuesday. The teenager allegedly gathered intelligence and painted graffiti for Ukrainian intelligence in exchange for money since autumn 2024. He reportedly admitted to scouting the refinery in January. The Ryazan refinery, 240 km south of Moscow, suspended operations after Ukraine’s drone attack, part of Kyiv’s broader strategy to disrupt Russia’s wartime energy infrastructure. Reuters

Turkey offers to host possible Ukraine-Russia talks. Turkey has offered to host potential Ukraine-Russia peace talks following Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Ankara on Monday. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan emphasized Turkey’s willingness to support negotiations but stressed both sides must participate. While President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity, Lavrov insisted that Ukraine abandoning its NATO bid remains a non-negotiable condition for Russia. This comes after U.S.-Russia talks in Riyadh excluded Kyiv, while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has described Turkey as a key security guarantor for Ukraine. Reuters

Three years in, Ukrainian fathers fear passing the war on to their sons. Three years into Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukrainian fathers and sons face difficult choices about war and identity. Many boys who were children when the war began are now approaching adulthood, confronting the possibility of military service. Some fathers, like Yehor and Andrii, have encouraged their sons to contribute in other ways, from drone-building to playing music for wounded soldiers. Others, like Maksym, fear their sons will be drawn into the conflict. Despite differing perspectives, all are deeply concerned about passing the burden of war onto the next generation, hoping for peace before their children must fight. Washington Post

UK’s Johnson doesn’t believe Trump will abandon Ukraine. Speaking on the sidelines of a conference in Kyiv on Monday, ex-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson dismissed fears that President Donald Trump had abandoned Ukraine, arguing that Trump’s rhetoric stems from misinformation and political maneuvering. “He listens to a lot of garbage about Ukraine,” Johnson said, referring to figures influencing Trump’s views. He attributed Trump’s push for a minerals deal to domestic politics, saying, “He has to show the isolationists in Congress, Tucker Carlson, and all these guys that he has something in exchange for continued American support.” While acknowledging concerns over the deal’s scale, Johnson defended its premise. “Yes, it looks like a lot of money, but not a single penny will go to the investment fund of profit if you do not have a free, sovereign, and secure Ukraine.” Johnson urged the UK and France to step up, stating, “We have to do a lot more. We signed the Budapest Memorandum.” NV

ISW Russian Offensive Campaign Assessment for Monday, Feb. 24. Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, aiming to seize Kyiv and install a pro-Russian regime, but Ukraine has remained resilient and innovative. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution recognizing Russia as the aggressor and reaffirming Ukraine’s sovereignty, while Russia and 16 other countries opposed it. Recent polls show growing Russian support for prolonging the war despite increasing economic hardships. Kremlin officials rejected any ceasefire that does not result in Ukraine’s capitulation, reinforcing Russia’s unwillingness to compromise in future negotiations. The Kremlin continues to use Muslim religious and cultural institutions in Russia as platforms for military recruitment.

Trump revokes Biden-era order on rights abuses with arms supplied by U.S. Officials on Monday said that the Trump administration has rescinded a Biden-era regulation, the National Security Memorandum-20, that required allies using U.S.-made weapons to adhere to international humanitarian law and facilitate humanitarian aid. This order, known as NSM-20, particularly impacted policies during Israel’s conflict with Hamas in Gaza. Biden’s directive had aimed to balance support for Israel with humanitarian concerns but faced criticism from both Republicans and Democrats; the former condemned the measure for its “redundant bureaucratic requirements,” while the latter castigated it for being inadequately enforced. Critics argue that repealing this measure signals disregard for human rights and could lead to increased civilian casualties, damaging America’s global reputation. Former State Department official Christopher Le Mon said the White House has effectively suggested to Washington’s partners that the Trump administration “simply doesn’t care how these governments use U.S. arms, no matter how immoral or illegal their conduct.” The GOP administration’s move continues its broader rollback of human rights-focused policies.

Trump says tariffs on Canada, Mexico going forward in spite of border and fentanyl efforts. President Donald Trump suggested on Monday that tariffs targeting Canada and Mexico are “going forward on time,” and scheduled to begin next month, as he aims to pressure both countries to enhance border security and reduce illegal immigration and drug trafficking. However, a U.S. official indicated uncertainty about the exact timing of these tariffs, particularly a 25% special levy linked directly to border concerns. Trump also announced broader reciprocal tariffs targeting multiple countries, set for April implementation, intended to create fairness in global trade and boost domestic manufacturing. He added that the U.S. has “been mistreated very badly by many countries, not just Canada and Mexico.” Economists warn these tariffs may raise consumer prices and disrupt supply chains, especially impacting sectors like automotive and energy. Canada strongly opposed Trump’s approach, suggesting reciprocal counter-tariffs as a possible response. Bloomberg Politico Associated Press Reuters 

Trump aid freeze disrupts anti-narcotics program at Mexican ports. President Donald Trump’s foreign aid freeze has stalled a United Nations anti-narcotics program in Mexico, disrupting efforts to stop fentanyl precursor chemicals from reaching drug cartels. The initiative provided Mexico’s Navy with training and equipment at key ports, including Manzanillo, but expansion to Veracruz and Lázaro Cárdenas is now on hold. While some U.S. security funding has resumed, most remains frozen, including $50 million intended to combat fentanyl trafficking. Experts warn the freeze undermines U.S. efforts to curb overdoses. Trump’s designation of Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations has fueled speculation about potential military action, though no legal basis currently exists .More than 450,000 Americans have died of synthetic opioid overdoses over the past decade, with millions more addicted Reuters

U.S. officials break with Musk’s directive, says responding to controversial email Is voluntary. Tensions appear to have emerged within the Trump administration after Elon Musk, heading the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, demanded that federal workers justify their weekly activities or face termination. Musk’s email to millions of federal workers sparked confusion and resistance among employees and senior officials, many of whom instructed staff to ignore his demand due to security and jurisdictional concerns. The directive has not only caused divisions within Trump’s cabinet, contrasting with his usual insistence on unified loyalty, but has also called into question the amount of authority Musk actually possesses within the GOP administration. Agencies such as the CIA and State Department quietly resisted the directive, worried about security, legality, and threats to classified information. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management clarified on Monday that Musk’s directive was voluntary, countering his original threat and urging employees not to disclose confidential, sensitive or classified information. Despite this, Trump and some senior aides praised the tech billionaire’s aggressive efforts to reform federal bureaucracy, referring to internal friction as a necessary cost. Musk took to social media on Monday evening to offer employees who did not respond to the email “another chance,” asserting that “failure to respond a second time will result in termination.” In a different post, he said that the “email request was utterly trivial, as the standard for passing the test was to type some words and press send!” Musk continued to blast the federal bureaucracy; “Yet so many failed even that inane test, urged on in some cases by their managers. Have you ever witnessed such INCOMPETENCE and CONTEMPT for how YOUR TAXES are being spent?” This internal dissent differs strikingly with Trump’s typical expectation of total alignment among aides. The controversy occurs just before Trump’s first cabinet meeting of his second term, underscoring broader tensions within his administration. New York Times Reuters BBC Time New York Post

Gutting of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management forewarns second wave of mass layoffs. The U.S. government’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is rapidly cutting entire departments and laying off career employees, actions that serve as a template for broader mass layoffs planned throughout federal agencies. Driven by President Trump’s ambitious vision, and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, these cuts target career civil servants, previously protected by strong employment safeguards. OPM has completely eliminated its 40-person procurement team, significantly reduced the group overseeing sensitive employee data, and disbanded teams focused on communications and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Approximately 50 OPM career employees were recently laid off through a formal reduction-in-force (RIF) process, a procedure that is typically lengthy and complex, but executed swiftly at OPM to demonstrate how other agencies could similarly reduce their workforce. Already, about 95,000 federal jobs have been cut, primarily through voluntary resignations or by firing probationary staff without career protections built up over years or decades. A second wave could eliminate hundreds of thousands more positions. Trump’s recent executive order requires agencies to hire only one employee for every four departures. Critics see these actions as severe, highlighting concerns over rapid downsizing, the weakening of employment protections, and the potentially undermining of critical government operations. Reuters

China is the U.S.’s most formidable technology, science rival, says Trump science policy nominee. Michael Kratsios, President Trump’s nominee to lead the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, has identified China as America’s “preeminent geopolitical rival” and primary competitor in technology and science, particularly in the sectors of artificial intelligence, quantum computing, nuclear fusion, and autonomous systems. In written testimony examined by Reuters, he warned that leadership in these areas will define the future global order. His comments come as the Trump administration continues to take aggressive measures against Beijing’s technological progress, including restricting Chinese investments in strategic sectors and possibly limiting U.S. investment in China. Previously, the Biden administration similarly tightened export controls on AI chips and effectively banned Chinese vehicles from the U.S. market. Reuters

Arizona is the latest state to mull bounties amid efforts to advance Trump’s ambitious deportation plans. Arizona’s legislature is considering a controversial bill that would pay police officers a $2,000 bounty for each detained undocumented immigrant. While the Republican-majority legislature is likely to pass the measure, Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs has promised to veto it, citing concerns over racial profiling and the inappropriate use of local police for federal immigration enforcement. Civil rights advocates argue the legislation would distract police from their primary duties and increase discrimination. Senator Lauren Kuby referred to the so-called bounty bill as the “Wild West with a twist,” condemning it as racist. Arizona has historically blurred local and federal immigration roles, notably under former Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Overriding a veto would require bipartisan support, which seems unlikely. Both Missouri and Mississippi recently weighed passing bills to pay out $1,000 to civilian bounty hunters for each illegal immigrant, but the legislation was rejected in Mississippi and is expected to fail in Missouri.
